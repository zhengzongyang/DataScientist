Learn to be a data scientist<br/>
To record the road about learning Machine Learning and Deep Learing<br/>  
Although I have been learning DL for like 2 years, but I just merely coding some DeepLearning modle or algorithm in practice. Just call somebody library to finish my job. <br/>
Because I think it's just like a black box, it is not worthy for me to figure out every detail about magic algorithm.<br/>
But chatGPT has change my perspective. <br/> 
Now I want to learn this hardcore tech, and maybe find a relevant job in this field.<br/>
Now I am a Java developer in a e-commerce company.<br/>
